    "Before we can get into the joys and wonder of Machine Learning we need to complete a neccessary evil: data pre-processing.  You see... Machine Learning is based on math not magic so the accuracy of the ML model is based, in a large part, on the quality of the data supplied to the model.  So before we start cranking away making predictions and plotting outcomes we need to feed the ML model high quality data \"food\" before it can attempt to divine the future.\n",

    "Depending on the dataset, there are usually four to six steps needed to get the data right before we can work with it.\n",
